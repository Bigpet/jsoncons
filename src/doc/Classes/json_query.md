    jsoncons::jsonpath::json_query

Returns a `json` array of `json` values extracted from a root `json` structure.

### Header

    #include "jsoncons/jsonpath/json_query.hpp"

    template<typename Char, class Alloc>
    basic_json<Char,Alloc> json_query(const basic_json<Char,Alloc>& root, 
                                      const std::basic_string<Char>& path);

[JsonPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) is a creation of Stefan Goessner. JSONPath expressions refer to a JSON text in the same way as XPath expressions refer to an XML document. 

Stefan Goessner's javascript implemention returns `false` in case of no match, but in a note he suggests an alternative is to return an empty array. The `jsoncons` implementation takes that alternative and returns an empty array in case of no match.
    
### Stefan Goessner's JsonPath

Unlike XML, the root of a JSON text is an anonymous object or array or scalar, so JSONPath identifies the outermost level of the text with the symbol $.

JSONPath expressions can use the dot–notation

    $.store.book.0.title

or the bracket–notation

    $['store']['book'][0]['title']

to describe input paths.

Note that only single quotes (not double quotes) are allowed inside of JSONPath expressions.

JSONPath|	Description
--------|--------------------------------
`$`|	The root object
`@`|	the current object
`.` or `[]`|	Child operator
`..`	|Recursive descent. JSONPath borrows this syntax from E4X.
`*` |	Wildcard. All objects/elements regardless their names.
`[]`	|Subscript operator. In JSON it is the native array operator.
`[,]`	|JSONPath allows alternate names or array indices as a set.
`[start:end:step]`	|Array slice operator borrowed from [ES4](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=proposals:slice_syntax&s=array+slice).
`?()`	|Applies a filter expression.
`()`	|Filter expression.

### jsoncons filter expressions

[Stefan Goessner's JsonPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) does not provide any specification for the allowable filter expressions, simply stating that expressions can be anything that the underlying script engine can handle. `jsoncons` expressions support the following comparision and arithmetic operators. 

Operator|	Description
--------|--------------------------------
`==`	|Left is equal to right 
`!=`	|Left is not equal to right
`<`	|Left is less than right
`<=`	|Left is less or equal to right
`>`	|Left is greater than right
`>=`	|Left is greater than or equal to right
`&&`	|Left and right
`||`	|Left or right
`+`     |Left plus right
`-`     |Left minus right

Binary expressions must appear within parentheses.

### Examples

The examples below use the JSON text from [Stefan Goessner's JsonPath](http://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) (store.json).

    { "store": {
        "book": [ 
          { "category": "reference",
            "author": "Nigel Rees",
            "title": "Sayings of the Century",
            "price": 8.95
          },
          { "category": "fiction",
            "author": "Evelyn Waugh",
            "title": "Sword of Honour",
            "price": 12.99
          },
          { "category": "fiction",
            "author": "Herman Melville",
            "title": "Moby Dick",
            "isbn": "0-553-21311-3",
            "price": 8.99
          },
          { "category": "fiction",
            "author": "J. R. R. Tolkien",
            "title": "The Lord of the Rings",
            "isbn": "0-395-19395-8",
            "price": 22.99
          }
        ],
        "bicycle": {
          "color": "red",
          "price": 19.95
        }
      }
    }

Our first example returns all authors whose books are cheaper than $10. 
    
    #include "jsoncons/json.hpp"
    #include "jsoncons_ext/jsonpath/json_query.hpp"

    using jsoncons::json;
    using jsoncons::pretty_print;
    using jsoncons::jsonpath::json_query;

    json root = json::parse_file("store.json");

    json result = json_query(root,"$.store.book[?(@.price < 10)].author");

    std::cout << pretty_print(result) << std::endl;

The result is

    ["Nigel Rees","Herman Melville"]

A list of sample JSON paths and results follows.

JSONPath |Result|Notes
---------|--------------------------------------------------------|------
`$..book.length`	|The number of books|`length` is a property of an array
`$.store.*`	            |Everything in the store, including books and a bicycle.|`*` is a wildcard symbol
`$.store.book[*].author`	|All authors of books in the store|
`$..author`	            |All authors
`$.store..price`	        |The prices of everything in the store.|
`$..book[2]`	            |The third book|Indices start at `0`
`$..book.2`	            |The third book|Using the dot notation
`$..book[(@.length-1)]`	        |The last book in order.|Expressions (<expr>) can be used as an alternative to explicit names or indices
`$..book[-1:]`	        |The last book in order.|A negative `start` becomes `start` + `length`. A missing `end` defaults to `length`.
`$..book[0,1]`            |The first two books
`$..book[:2]`	            |All books from index 0 (inclusive) to index 2 (exclusive)|`start` defaults to 0
`$..book[1:2]`              |All books from index 1 (inclusive) to index 2 (exclusive)
`$..book[-2:]`	|Last two books|The start index `-2` becomes `-2+4=2`, `end` defaults to `length` (`4`).
`$..book[2:]`	|Last two books|`end` defaults to `length`
`$..book[?(@.isbn)]`	    |All books that have isbn number
`$..book[?(@.price<10)]`	|All books that are cheaper than $10
`$..*`	                |Everything in the store.
`$.store.book[ ?((@.author == 'Nigel Rees') || (@.author == 'Evelyn Waugh')) ].title`|The titles of all books by Nigel Rees and Evelyn Waugh
